Hello World Example
===================

This repository contains a worked example for testing a "hello world" python script. It is used in a [TextTest tutorial](http://texttest.org/tutorials/hello_world.html).

To run these tests, first install TextTest. See [TextTest Documentation](https://texttest.org/) 

Then launch the texttest command-line test runner:

	texttest -con

If you are using PyCharm or similar, there should be a Run Configuration available called "RunTextTest" or "RunTextTestWindows". If you have used the Windows installer, use the "RunTextTestWindows" configuration, otherwise use the RunTextTest configuration to run the tests.
